1.  Introduction

   BKDF is a memory-hard password hashing and password-based key
   derivation function based on Balloon [BCS16], an algorithm published
   shortly after the Password Hashing Competition (PHC).  It has several
   advantages over prior password hashing algorithms:

   *  It has proven memory-hardness properties, making it resistant
      against sequential GPU/ASIC attacks.  An adversary trying to save
      space pays a large penalty in computation time.

   *  It can be instantiated with any collision-resistant PRF, hash
      function, or XOF, making it a mode of operation for these existing
      algorithms.  No new, unstudied primitives are required.

   *  It uses a password-independent memory access pattern, making it
      resistant to cache-timing attacks.  This property is especially
      relevant in cloud computing environments where multiple users can
      share the same physical machine.

   *  It is intuitive to understand and easy to implement, which reduces
      the risk of implementation mistakes.

   BKDF exists because the Balloon paper does not fully specify the
   algorithm, the algorithm was not designed with key derivation in
   mind, and there are multiple variants.

   This document rectifies these issues and more by specifying an
   encoding, preventing canonicalization attacks, improving domain
   separation, not computing the memory accesses from the salt, fixing
   the modulo bias, making delta a constant, treating Balloon and
   Balloon-M as one algorithm, adding support for key derivation, adding
   support for a pepper and associated data, adding support for keyed
   hashing like HMAC [RFC2104], and improving the performance.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
   “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and
   “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Throughout this document, “byte” refers to the same unit as “octet”,
   namely an 8-bit sequence.

   Operations:

   *  x++: incrementing the integer x by 1 after it has been used in a
      function.

   *  a ^ b: the bitwise XOR of a and b.

   *  a % b: the remainder when dividing a by b.

   *  a || b: the concatenation of a and b.

   *  a[i]: index i of array a.

   *  a.Length: the length of a in bytes.

   *  a.Slice(i, l): the copy of l bytes from byte array a, starting at
      index i.

   *  ByteArray(l): the creation of a new byte array with length l.

      b byte arrays, each with length l.

   *  PRF(k, m): the output of a collision-resistant PRF (e.g.  HMAC-
      SHA512 [RFC2104]) with key k and message m, both byte arrays.  If
      the collision-resistant hash function supports a key parameter
      (e.g.  BLAKE2b [RFC7693]), that parameter MUST be used.
      Otherwise, if there is no key parameter (e.g.  SHA-512 [RFC6234]),
      you MUST perform prefix MAC and pad the key with zeros to the
      block size (1024 bits for SHA-512).

      array, which is 4294967295 bytes.

3.  The BKDF Algorithm

BKDF(password, salt, spaceCost, timeCost, parallelism, length, pepper, associatedData)

   BKDF calls an internal function that provides memory hardness in a
   way that supports parallelism and then produces a variable-length
   output.  It can be divided into three steps:

   1.  KDF Extract: a key is derived from the password, salt, pepper,
       and associated data.

   2.  Parallelism: the internal function, which uses the derived key as
       well as other user-provided parameters, is called in parallel,
       and the outputs are XORed together.

   3.  KDF Expand: a KDF in feedback mode is used to derive key material
       for the user from the derived key, context information, and the
       XORed outputs.

   Note that the internal function calls MUST be implemented in
   parallel, not serially.  Otherwise, the parallelism parameter
   essentially becomes another timeCost parameter.

   Inputs:

   *  password: the password to be hashed, which MUST NOT be greater
      than MAX_PASSWORD bytes long.

   *  salt: the unique salt, which MUST NOT be greater than MAX_SALT
      bytes long.

   *  spaceCost: the memory size in 2**spaceCost blocks, where a block
      is HASH_LEN bytes long.  It MUST be an integer between
      MIN_SPACECOST and MAX_SPACECOST.

   *  timeCost: the number of rounds, which MUST be an integer between
      MIN_TIMECOST and MAX_TIMECOST.

   *  parallelism: the number of CPU cores/internal function calls in
      parallel, which MUST be an integer between MIN_PARALLELISM and
      MAX_PARALLELISM.

   *  length: the length of the password hash/derived key in bytes,
      which MUST NOT be greater than MAX_LENGTH.

   *  pepper: an optional secret key, which MUST NOT be greater than
      MAX_PEPPER bytes long.

   *  associatedData: an array of arrays for optional context
      information.  The number of arrays MUST NOT be greater than
      MAX_ASSOCIATED_DATAS, and each array MUST NOT be greater than
      MAX_ASSOCIATED_DATA bytes long.

   Outputs:

   *  The password hash/derived key, which is length bytes long.

   Steps:

outputs = BlockArray(parallelism, HASH_LEN)

if pepper.Length == 0
    key = ZeroPad(ByteArray(0), HASH_LEN)
else
    key = pepper

ad = ByteArray(0)
for i = 0 to associatedData.Length - 1
    ad = ad || LE32(associatedData[i].Length) || associatedData[i]

key = PRF(key, LE32(password.Length) || password || LE32(salt.Length) || salt || ad)

parallel for i = 0 to parallelism - 1
    outputs[i] = BalloonCore(key, spaceCost, timeCost, parallelism, i + 1)

hash = ByteArray(HASH_LEN)
foreach output in outputs
    for i = 0 to output.Length - 1
        hash[i] = hash[i] ^ output[i]

counter = 1
reps = Ceiling(length / HASH_LEN)
previous = ByteArray(0)
result = ByteArray(0)
for i = 0 to reps
    previous = PRF(key, previous || LE32(counter++) || UTF8("bkdf") || hash)
    result = result || previous

return result.Slice(0, length)

4.  The BalloonCore Function

   BalloonCore(key, spaceCost, timeCost, parallelism, iteration)

   The BalloonCore function is the internal function used by BKDF for
   memory hardness.  It can be divided into three steps:

   1.  Expand: a large buffer is filled with pseudorandom bytes derived
       by hashing user-provided parameters and domain separation before
       repeatedly hashing the previous output.

   2.  Mix: the buffer is mixed for the number of rounds specified by
       the user.  Each hash-sized block becomes equal to the hash of the
       previous block, the current block, and delta other blocks
       pseudorandomly chosen from the buffer.

   3.  Extract: the last block of the buffer is output for key
       derivation.

   Inputs:

   *  key: the key from the BKDF algorithm.

   *  spaceCost: the space cost provided to the BKDF algorithm.

   *  timeCost: the time cost provided to the BKDF algorithm.

   *  parallelism: the parallelism provided to the BKDF algorithm.

   *  iteration: the parallelism loop iteration from the BKDF algorithm.

   Outputs:

   *  The last block of the buffer, which is HASH_LEN bytes long.

   Steps:

spaceCost = 2**spaceCost
buffer = BlockArray(spaceCost, HASH_LEN)

counter = 0
emptyKey = ZeroPad(ByteArray(0), HASH_LEN)
pseudorandom = ByteArray(0)
reps = (spaceCost * timeCost * 3) / (HASH_LEN / 4)
for i = 0 to reps - 1
    pseudorandom = pseudorandom || PRF(emptyKey, LE64(counter++) || LE32(spaceCost) || LE32(timeCost) || LE32(parallelism) || LE32(iteration))

buffer[0] = PRF(key, LE64(counter++) || LE32(spaceCost) || LE32(timeCost) || LE32(parallelism) || LE32(iteration))
for m = 1 to spaceCost - 1
    buffer[m] = PRF(key, LE64(counter++) || buffer[m - 1])

offset = 0
previous = buffer[spaceCost - 1]
for t = 0 to timeCost - 1
    for m = 0 to spaceCost - 1
        other1 = ReadLE32(pseudorandom.Slice(offset, 4)) % spaceCost
        other2 = ReadLE32(pseudorandom.Slice(offset + 4, 4)) % spaceCost
        other3 = ReadLE32(pseudorandom.Slice(offset + 8, 4)) % spaceCost
        buffer[m] = PRF(key, LE64(counter++) || previous || buffer[m] || buffer[other1] || buffer[other2] || buffer[other3])
        previous = buffer[m]
        offset = offset + 12

return previous

5.  Implementation Considerations

   There are several ways to optimise the pseudocode, which is written
   for readability:

   *  Instead of using an array of byte arrays for the buffer, access
      portions of a single large byte array.

   *  Instead of an integer counter that gets repeatedly converted to a
      byte array, allocate a byte array once and repeatedly fill that
      buffer or use a byte array counter.

   *  Instead of x % spaceCost, one can do x & (spaceCost - 1) because
      spaceCost is a power of 2.

   *  Skip the XORing of outputs when parallelism = 1.

   *  Create a single buffer full of zeros for the key derivation
      padding rather than padding the two variables separately.

   *  Instead of Ceiling(length / HASH_LEN), one can do (length +
      HASH_LEN - 1) / HASH_LEN.

   *  Convert the key derivation domain separation string to bytes once
      rather than in each iteration of the loop.

   *  Use an incremental hash function API rather than manual
      concatenation.

   *  If possible with the hash function API, cache the hash function
      state after processing the key so it does not need to be processed
      again.

6.  Choosing the Hash Function

   The choice of collision-resistant hash function affects the
   performance and security of BKDF in two ways:

   1.  For the same parameters, the attacker has an advantage if the
       algorithm is faster in hardware versus software.  They will be
       able to do the computation in less time than the defender.

   2.  For the same delay, the defender will be forced to use smaller
       parameters with a slower collision-resistant hash function in
       software.  Using a faster algorithm in software means stronger
       parameters can be used.

   It is RECOMMENDED to use a collision-resistant hash function that is
   fast in software but relatively slow in hardware, such as BLAKE2b
   [RFC7693].  As another example, SHA-512 is preferable to SHA-256
   [RFC6234].  Finally, SHA-3 [FIPS202] is NOT RECOMMENDED as it is
   slower in software compared to in hardware.

7.  Choosing the Parameters

   The higher the spaceCost and timeCost, the longer it takes to compute
   an output.  If these values are too small, security is unnecessarily
   reduced.  If they are too large, there is a risk of user frustration
   and denial-of-service for different types of user devices and
   servers.  To make matters even more complicated, these parameters may
   need to be increased over time as hardware gets faster/smaller.

   The purpose of parallelism is to enable greater memory hardness
   without increasing the delay.  This is because the mixing is done by
   multiple CPU cores simultaneously rather than serially.  However, a
   poor choice of parallelism can also cause denial-of-service or give
   the attacker an advantage.

   The following procedure can be used to choose parameters:

   1.  For performing authentication on a server or running the
       algorithm on any type of user device, set the parallelism to 1.
       This avoids resource exhaustion attacks and slowdowns on machines
       with few CPU cores.  Otherwise, set it to the maximum number of
       CPU cores the machine can dedicate to the computation.

   2.  Establish the maximum acceptable delay for the user.  For
       example, 100-500 ms for authentication, 250-1000 ms for file
       encryption, and 1000-5000 ms for disk encryption.  On servers,
       you also need to factor in the maximum number of authentication
       attempts per second.

   3.  Determine the maximum amount of memory available, taking into
       account different types of user devices and denial-of-service.
       For instance, mobile phones versus laptops/desktops.

   4.  Convert the closest MiB/GiB memory size that is a power of 2 to
       bytes.  Then set spaceCost to log2(bytes / HASH_LEN), which is
       the binary logarithm of the number of blocks.

   5.  Find the timeCost that brings you closest to the maximum
       acceptable delay or target number of authentication attempts per
       second by running benchmarks.

   6.  If timeCost is only 1, reduce spaceCost to be able to increase
       timeCost.  Performing multiple rounds is beneficial for security
       [AB17].

   To cause an attacker to get < 10 kH/s on an RTX 4080 Super GPU, the
   parameters must be at least one of the following when using SHA-256,
   SHA-512, HMAC-SHA256, or HMAC-SHA512 as the collision-resistant PRF:

   *  SHA-256: m=256 KiB, t=48; m=512 KiB, t=24; m=1 MiB, t=12; m=2 MiB,
      t=6

   *  SHA-512: m=256 KiB, t=34; m=512 KiB, t=17; m=1 MiB, t=9; m=2 MiB,
      t=4

   *  HMAC-SHA256: m=256 KiB, t=36; m=512 KiB, t=18; m=1 MiB, t=9; m=2
      MiB, t=5

   *  HMAC-SHA512: m=256 KiB, t=26; m=512 KiB, t=13; m=1 MiB, t=7; m=2
      MiB, t=3

   In all cases, it is RECOMMENDED to use a 128-bit salt.  However, a
   64-bit salt MAY be used if there are storage constraints.
   Regardless, the salt length SHOULD NOT vary in your protocol/
   application.  See Section 9 for guidance on generating the salt.

   For password hashing, it is RECOMMENDED to use a length of 128 or 256
   bits.  For key derivation, it is RECOMMENDED to use a length of at
   least 128 bits.

8.  Encoding Password Hashes

   To store BKDF hashes in a database as strings, the following format
   SHOULD be used:

   $bkdf-hash$v=version$m=spaceCost,t=timeCost,p=parallelism$salt$hash

   *  bkdf-hash: where hash is the official hash function OID minus any
      prefix (e.g. id-).  For example, blake2b512 for BLAKE2b-512
      [RFC7693].

   *  v=version: this is version 1 of BKDF.  If the design is modified,
      the version will be incremented.

   *  m=spaceCost: the space cost as a number, not the memory size in
      blocks or KiB.

   *  t=timeCost: the number of rounds.

   *  p=parallelism: the number of CPU cores/internal function calls in
      parallel.

   *  salt: the salt encoded in Base64 with no padding [RFC4648].

   *  hash: the full/untruncated BKDF output encoded in Base64 with no
      padding [RFC4648].

   Here is an example encoded hash:

$bkdf-sha256$v=1$m=32,t=3,p=1$ZXhhbXBsZXNhbHQ$cWBD3/d3tEqnuI3LqxLAeKvs+snSicW1GVlnqmNEDfs

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Usage Guidelines

   Technically, only preimage resistance is required for password
   hashing to prevent the attacker learning information about the
   password from the hash.  However, hash functions that are not
   collision resistant (e.g.  MD5 [RFC6151] and SHA-1 [RFC6194]) MUST
   NOT be used.  Such functions are cryptographically weak and
   unsuitable for new protocols.

   If possible, store the password in protected memory and/or erase the
   password from memory once it is no longer required.  Otherwise, an
   attacker may be able to recover the password from memory or the disk.

   The salt MUST be unique each time you call the function unless
   verifying a password hash or deriving the same key.  It SHOULD be
   randomly generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom
   number generator (CSPRNG).  However, it MAY be deterministic and
   predictable if random generation is not possible.

   The spaceCost, timeCost, and parallelism MUST be carefully chosen to
   avoid denial-of-service and user frustration whilst ensuring adequate
   protection against password cracking.  See the Section 7 section for
   more information.

   If you want to derive multiple keys (e.g. for encryption and
   authentication), you MUST only run the algorithm once and use
   different portions of the output as separate keys.  Otherwise, the
   attacker may have an advantage, like only needing to run the
   algorithm once instead of twice to check a password, and you will be
   forced to use weaker parameters.

   Avoid using hardcoded spaceCost/timeCost/parallelism parameters when
   performing password hashing; these SHOULD be stored as part of the
   password hash, as described in Section 8.  With key derivation,
   hardcoded parameters are acceptable if protocol versioning is used.

   For password hashing, it is RECOMMENDED to encrypt password hashes
   using an unauthenticated encryption algorithm or an authenticated
   encryption with associated data (AEAD) scheme [RFC5116] before
   storage.  This forces an attacker to compromise the key, which is
   stored separately from the database, as well as the database before
   they can begin password cracking.  If the key is compromised but the
   database is not, it can be rotated without having to reset any
   passwords.

   For key derivation, one can feed a secret key into the pepper
   parameter for additional security.  This forces an attacker to
   compromise the pepper before they can guess the password.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to use a 256-bit pepper.

   To bind context information to the output, like a user ID and server
   ID for password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) algorithms, the
   associatedData parameter can be used.  However, in most cases, this
   parameter is not required.

9.2.  Security Guarantees

   The security properties of BKDF depend on the chosen collision-
   resistant hash function.  For example, a 256-bit hash typically
   provides 128-bit collision resistance and 256-bit (second) preimage
   resistance.

   Balloon has been proven sequentially memory-hard in the random-oracle
   model and uses a password-independent memory access pattern to
   prevent side-channel attacks leaking information about the password
   [BCS16].  However, no function that uses a password-independent
   memory access pattern can be optimally memory-hard in the parallel
   setting [AB16].  In other words, Balloon is inherently weaker against
   parallel attacks.

   To improve resistance against parallel attacks, the output can be fed
   into a password hashing function with a password-dependent memory
   access pattern, such as scrypt [RFC7914] or Argon2d [RFC9106].  The
   cost of this approach is like increasing the timeCost of BKDF
   [BCS16].  However, even this does not defend against an attacker who
   can both a) obtain memory access pattern information and b) perform a
   massively parallel attack; it only protects against the two attacks
   separately.

   Unlike password hashing algorithms such as bcrypt [PM99], which
   perform many small pseudorandom reads, BKDF is not cache-hard.
   Whilst there are no known publications on cache-hardness at the time
   of writing, it is reported to provide better GPU/ASIC resistance than
   memory-hardness for shorter delays (e.g. < 1000 ms).  In such cases,
   memory bandwidth and CPU cache sizes are bigger bottlenecks than
   total memory.  This makes cache-hard algorithms ideal for
   authentication scenarios but potentially less suited for key
   derivation.

   Third-party analysis of Balloon can be found in [RD16], [AB17],
   [ABP17], and [RD17].  However, note that there are multiple versions
   of Balloon, and none of these papers have analysed BKDF.
